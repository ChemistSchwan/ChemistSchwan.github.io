About Me
--------

I’m Dr. Sebastian Schwan, a chemist and materials scientist with a passion for innovation, precision, and meaningful impact. My professional focus lies at the intersection of science, technology, and process optimization — transforming complex challenges into efficient, sustainable solutions.

With a background in industrial research and development, I bring experience in laboratory management, data-driven process improvement, and interdisciplinary collaboration. I hold a Six Sigma Green Belt certification and enjoy combining analytical thinking with creativity to drive progress in technical environments.

Beyond my work, I’m inspired by nature, music, and problem-solving — whether refining a process, climbing a mountain, or designing an aquascape in one of my planted aquariums.
